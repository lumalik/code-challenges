def race(v1,v2,g):
    '''Two tortoises named A and B must run a race. A starts with an average speed of 720 feet per hour. Young B knows she runs faster than A, and furthermore has not finished her cabbage.

    When she starts, at last, she can see that A has a 70 feet lead but B's speed is 850 feet per hour. How long will it take B to catch A?

    More generally: given two speeds v1 (A's speed, integer > 0) and v2 (B's speed, integer > 0) and a lead g (integer > 0) how long will it take B to catch A?

    The result will be an array [hour, min, sec] which is the time needed in hours, minutes and seconds (round down to the nearest second) or a string in some languages.

    If v1 >= v2 then return nil, nothing, null, None or {-1, -1, -1} for C++, C, Go, Nim, [] for Kotlin or "-1 -1 -1". '''
    if v1>=v2:
        return None
    difference = abs(v1-v2)
    hours_until_catch = float(g)/float(difference)
    hours = int(hours_until_catch)
    minutes = int((hours_until_catch - hours)*60)
    seconds = int((hours_until_catch - hours - (minutes/60))*3600)
    return([hours,minutes,seconds])
